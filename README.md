# Mood Tracker
In the initial stages of development.

## Description
This app allows the user to track their mood day-to-day, and identify the correlations between behaviors (such as diet and sleep hygiene) and how they feel. 

It's not that the technology to identify these patterns doesn't exist, the problem is that it's a chore. I developed this for people with bipolar in mind. To identify their triggers, itâ€™s really strongly suggested for people with bipolar to keep track of what they do, how they sleep and what they eat. Believe it or not, it's very boring. This app proposes a solution to find a lazy - and hopefully pleasant way - for the user to do something small that leads to more freedom and happiness in their lives.  

Anyone interested in practicing mindfulness, or who just wants to feel better, can benefit.
